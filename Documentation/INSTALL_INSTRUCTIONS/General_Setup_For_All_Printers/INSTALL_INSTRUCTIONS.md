# GENERAL SETUP FOR ALL PRINTERS

### IF YOU RAN V1.0-V2.8 BE SURE TO UPDATE YOUR SLICER'S START GCODE OR NEW FEATURES WONT WORK!
**Instructions to do this are further down this page.**
**Also you must update ALL the macro files as this new version will NOT work correctly with old files!**

****************************************************************************************************************************

### Orca Slicer

Make sure you have the latest 2.2.0 (beta2 or later) version of Orca Slicer DO NOT USE ORCA SLICER DOT NET!!! BAD!!!

This link GOOD!

# UPDATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION

>[!TIP]
>Thanks to this amazing community we have our first official contribution to Demon Klipper Essentials Unified! This contribution now allows you to update your demon_user_settings cfg file across versions via interactive SSH Python script where it'll give you choices to bring in or bypass previously set values from your old files!!

To use this new feature you'll need to install a couple of things first. SSH into your printer.
    
``` 
python3 -m pip install rich
```

Wait for this to complete then run.

```
python3 -m pip install ConfigUpdater
```

These commands will install the libaries you need to run the interactive user file updater script.

To use the feature use this command...

```
python3 ~/printer_data/config/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/Other_Files/Demon_Install_Script/Demon_config_update.py
```

# Preparing Your Current System

- Make a backup of your current system now! Be sure you at least download your current `/config` folder BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE!! You want have a set of UNTOUCHED files to refer back to if needed!

- Disable your current macros for START_PRINT & END_PRINT, plus any others you dont need including any for calibration & levelling. [Tips on how to do this quickly here!](https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/blob/main/Documentation/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/General_Setup_For_All_Printers/Your_Current_Macro_Files.md)

### Did you already do this???

- Don't miss this out, you need them! [INSTALL PREREQUISITES](https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/blob/main/Documentation/Prerequisites/Prerequisites.md)


### Not Sure How to SSH?

- If you're not too sure on how to "SSH" or would simply like to check you're doing things correctly [click here!](https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/blob/main/Documentation/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/General_Setup_For_All_Printers/How_To_SSH.md)

# Troubleshooting Save Variables Section

>[!TIP]
>This is important so it's at the top where you might see it, as if not correct it'll cause the following issues...

<details>
    <summary>
        <b>
        Click to expand - What if you get a EOF error?
        </b>
    </summary>
<p>
</p>
The error below should now be rare if new SSH installer is used!

If this file is not present on your first reboot but you have already added the `[save_variables]` section you'll see this error:

![EOF Error](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2da883e7-9228-47ae-9637-976b54ce0db0)


Don't worry though this is just telling you the system created the file but it does not have the required saved variable within the file. After you have included the Demon macros in your printer.cfg file you can then home the printer to create the variable within the file to clear the error. Unless you're running `Klicky Probe` then please [see here](https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/blob/main/Documentation/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/General_Setup_For_All_Printers/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.md#unless-youre-using-klicky-probe) as simply homing the printer wont clear the error unless you have edited the Klicky macros first.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
        <b>
        Click to expand - What if you get a popup boot loop message?
        </b>
    </summary>
<p>
</p>
If you get a boot looping popup message that wont go away check your system for any other [save_variables] sections or any other defined filenames!

If you feel your demon_vars.cfg file is not working you can reinstall it directly from your current version of the `Demon Klipper Essentials Unified` macros.

```
cp -f ~/printer_data/config/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/Other_Files/Demon_Vars/demon_vars.cfg ~/
```

If that doesnt work try changing your filename line to:
```
[save_variables]
filename = ~/demon_vars.cfg
```

Also double check you have no other `[save_variables]` sections defined in your system. 

Then Save & Restart.

### File Structure Has Changed for v2.9.4 Onwards

<details>
    <summary>
        <b>
        Click to expand - File Structure Has Changed for v2.9.4 Onwards
        </b>
    </summary>
<p>
</p>
There is a new setup in the file structure of these macros. There is now a second directory that is now auto extracted to your config directory during install. This is done so to keep the main install's "clean" status intact in the Update Manager. This is what the functional system looks like. 

#### After the initial install of `Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified`.

The image below is what your config directory should look like after the initial install has completed. 

If the `Demon_User_Files` directory & contained files are not present then the system is not ready for use! This directory also needs to be included in to the system - explained later on.

![Demon_Config_DIR](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54e85efb-5d9d-4e3e-a90e-a58710cf15a3)


Check inside the `Demon_User_Files` directory you should see these 3 files, there could also be a system created archive directory if you had these files here before...

![Demon_User_Files](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbd26215-be8c-4d45-9869-a7c23db06cb5)


If your directory is empty please click the reload button for your web browser to refresh the Mainsail page.

### FEATURE: DEMON DIAGNOSTICS!

>[!TIP]
> BE SURE TO USE THIS WHEN SETTING UP! It's your onboard helper tool!
>This sytem will help you see whats been done, what needs doing & what is not correctly set yet!

<details>
    <summary>
        <b>
        Click to expand - FEATURE: DEMON DIAGNOSTICS!
        </b>
    </summary>
<p>
</p>
Once you have installed the main files this is an awesome new adaptive script (run from ssh) that will revolutionise your Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified install process! 
Each time you run it the utility will scan your system in its current state & it'll show you your progress with getting everything setup, think of it as your installation copilot, or your own little red devil on your shoulder! 

### RUN FROM YOUR SSH TERMINAL WITH THIS COMMAND!
```
sh ~/printer_data/config/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/Other_Files/Demon_Diagnostics/Demon_Diagnostics.sh
```

The script will tell you exactly what you currently have defined, included & installed at the time of the system scan! It'll also tell you if there's something not defined, or if there's something missing. It will tell you if a file is installed but not included or even if it's been defined/included multiple times! 

Your ssh terminal will tell you what you need to do to complete the install correctly & not miss anything. It'll warn you if anything is wrong.
Run it at each stage of your install as many times as you like to make sure you're getting everything done! 

### The goal is to make as many GREEN lines as possible!

The utility will scan & evaluate your printer.cfg & moonraker.conf files to check how you're doing & to make sure you don't miss anything that's needed by the macros.

![DD-2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8af1ef75-73ff-49db-b9c7-2bd7fb704ccb)


The system will also give you big red warnings with clear explanations when things are not correct!

![DD-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ad99cc6-6008-413c-9250-b9a2f45d3b7c)


NOTE THIS SCRIPT MAKES NO CHANGES TO ANY OF YOUR FILES 

It just scans them safely & leaves them unedited & unchanged!

</details>

![DD-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24fcda75-5418-4b3f-95c1-73c2197f6e45)

>[!NOTE]
>This diagnostic tool is extremely strict & will not allow hashed out comments or white space (spaces) after any printer.cfg sections or include commands. Keep this in mind if you can't turn a section green!

****************************************************************************************************************************

### FEATURE: DEMON USER FILES UPDATER!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you run this system but include the wrong file or it contains the wrong user account name the system will still be able to run but have an error due to the user account name & NO FILES WILL BE WRITTEN!


<details>
    <summary>
        <b>
        Click to expand - FEATURE: DEMON USER FILES UPDATER!
        </b>
    </summary>
<p>
</p> 

This new feature is a quality of life system that's useful if you'd like the macros to help manage your new `Demon_User_Files` directory & for it to automatically notify you if the version number has changed on these files & give you the option to auto extract the new versions from your updated macros.

This new system uses the `Kiauh` `G-code Shell Command Extension` optional install. If your user files need updating it will prompt you to extract the required files from the main `Demon Klipper Essentials Unified` directory & place them in the new directory `Demon_User_Files` outside of the managed main directory, this is directly inside your printer's `config` directory. It will also move your current files to a `Previous_Versions` directory & place the new updated files in the `Demon_User_Files` directory ready for you to transpose your previous settings onto them. This system will even create numbered backups of the files it moves if the version numbers are the same as before so you will never lose your settings. 

To use this awesome new feature you have to have the `Kiauh` `G-code Shell Command Extension` installed on your system as mentioned in the [prerequisites section](https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/blob/main/Documentation/Prerequisites/Prerequisites.md#optional---kiauh-g-code-shell-command-extension---optional). Then you need to add *ONE* of these include commands to activate the feature depending on what Pi system you're using. There are 4 pre-made ones for the most popular systems.

<br>

### Manual User File Placement

If you choose to manage the system yourself manually & not to use the `Demon_User_Files_Updater` you will need to create a new directory inside your `config` directory called `Demon_User_Files`.

Then you'll need to navigate to `/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/Other_Files/DEMON_User_Files_SOURCE` & copy the three user settings .cfg files inside into your new `Demon_User_Files` directory that you just created outside of the main `Demon Klipper Essentials` directory. So the file structure looks like [this...](https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/blob/main/Documentation/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/General_Setup_For_All_Printers/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.md#the-file-structure-has-changed-for-v294-onwards)

### Macro Layout Import/Restore

Lastly in Mainsail click the cogs top right of the screen & then click the `RESTORE` button in the `Interface Settings` window under the `General` tab. Now find the `backup-mainsail-DEMON-MACROS-v2.9.json` file, click open & then select the macros option, then click `Restore` to bring in the macro setup.

This will bring in the defualt macro layout.
- [CLICK HERE FOR MACRO LAYOUT FILE](https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/tree/main/Other_Files/DEMON_Macro_layout_JSON)

It will not change your toolhead layout, you will need to do this yourself if you wish to. This is done by changing the `Style` option in the `Control` tab of the `Interface Settings` window to `Circle`.

![P_N_S](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc9cafb2-aaea-4c4e-b18e-8c8c51f850dc)

There's a whole new way to purge filament on any printer! Use a dedicated purge area or the edge of your print bed to create a poop pellet & use the nozzle/toolhead to shoot it into the bucket! Fully customisable features!

Activate with the demon_user_settings_cleaner_variables .cfg file!

Choose many diiferent options, adjust & tune settings, including...

Positions - place the pellet where you want!

Parking - park the toolhead where you like!

Height - choose your height!

Speed - choose how fast or slow!

Temps - select what temps you want!

Feed lengths - choose load/unload & purge lengths!

Poop flow rate - tune the flow of poop!

Shoot direction - shoot your poop any way you like!

Program extras - pauses, extra cleans, turn fans on sooner!

Random Spot - never shoot from the same spot twice! Vary pellet placement within a chosen range!

Plus the printer knows if you have loaded or unloaded the filament even if you restart! It will know if you need a full load or unload or a simple purge & clean!!

# Define Save Variables Section

Add this to your `printer.cfg` preferably BEFORE you include the macros. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Be sure to comment out any other [save_variables] already in your printer.cfg, if you don't the system can't update the demon_vars.cfg variable file.

```
[save_variables]
filename = ~/demon_vars.cfg
```


****************************************************************************************************************************

<br>

# Set Up Your Mainsail.cfg File!

You will need to configure your `Mainsail.cfg` `_CLIENT_VARIABLE` macro, set it up now! 

[Click here to do that!](https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/blob/main/Documentation/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/General_Setup_For_All_Printers/Set_Up%20_Your_Mainsail.cfg.md)

If you choose *NOT* to use the Mainsail.cfg...

>[!TIP]
>These macros make use of the `respond` command & is already defined in the your `Mainsail.cfg` file so if you are not going to use it please make sure your printer.cfg has this defined for use in the system, you will need to add the section manually. 

```
[respond]
```

****************************************************************************************************************************

<br>

# Include Now!

### Main Directory Includes

Now is a good time to use the include commands to bring the files into your system as you have the very basic requirements for the macros to run. 

Copy the code block below & paste it at the top of your `printer.cfg` file & then click the `Save & Restart` button to restart Klipper!

>[!IMPORTANT]
>It is vitally important that you have the `demon_vars.cfg` file & `[save_variables]` section in-place before you include these files, If you used the new SSH installer it will have been placed for you. You can jump back to [here](https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/blob/main/Documentation/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/General_Setup_For_All_Printers/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.md#define-save-variables-section) to confirm you did the step for the `[save_variables]` section, there is even a SSH command to manually place the `demon_vars.cfg` file if you need it.

```
[include ./Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/*.cfg]
[include ./Demon_User_Files/*.cfg]
```
Your full include list should look like this example from my Voron 2.4 - the additional files used for your printer may well be different to mine depending on your machine & setup


![Includes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0555c56b-a2f8-4efd-b2e1-ebb58a0fd8e6)

### Demon User File Updater Includes

>[!NOTE]
>If you have a non-standard user account name you will need to go in & adjust the file paths in the actual file you choose for it to work. 

If you have a Raspberry Pi based system:
```
[include ./Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/Other_Files/Demon_User_Files_Updater/Extract_Demon_User_Files_Rpi.cfg]
```
If you have a Biqu based system:
```
[include ./Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/Other_Files/Demon_User_Files_Updater/Extract_Demon_User_Files_Biqu.cfg]
```
If you have a Sovol based system:
```
[include ./Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/Other_Files/Demon_User_Files_Updater/Extract_Demon_User_Files_Sovol.cfg]
```
If you have a MKS based system:
```
[include ./Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/Other_Files/Demon_User_Files_Updater/Extract_Demon_User_Files_MKS.cfg]
```

Then once you restart your system you'll be greeted by new system prompts telling you if anyhting needs to be done to get your system ready for use, & the option to let the system handle it or if you'd like to do it manually. If you select the `EXTRACT` option the system will copy the default files ready for you to edit & setup to a new directory. It will also handle any old files already there if there are any, you wont loose them.


If you're using the `Demon User Files Updater` after the restart & if any file needs updating your system will present you with extract files prompt where you should select `EXTRACT` & after the automated restart you should reload your browser page to display the new `Demon_User_Files` directory that will contain your new editable settings files & `demon_custom_expansion` macro file.

These files are placed here outside of the main `Demon Klipper Essentials Unified` directory so that it will remain prestine for use with Mainsails `Update Manager` as described below. this means you wont loose your edits to the settings files when the system detects you have modified the managed files, or when you update the `Demon Klipper Essentials Unified` macros in the future. The local `Demon User Files Updater` will then see the updated files & offer to extract a new set of `Demon_User_Files` for you automatically while archiving your old ones for safekeeping & reference. New files will be at default values.

>[!NOTE]
>Don't home the printer yet unless you have the `force_move` section defined & know the default homing settings are suitable for your machine!

****************************************************************************************************************************

# Demon Klipper Essentials Mainsail Updates

To be notifed of main macro pack updates & to be able to install them with a single click from your Mainsail web interface paste the block below into your `moonraker.conf` file, its a good idea to keep it under the `update_manager` section.

Also please note that if you do not use the new installer to update but instead jusy rely on Update Manager to update from v2.9.3 or lower you must run this ssh script before you update via mainsail from your old version for the first time. It will make sure your demon_vars.cfg file is also updated & ready for v2.9.4 

```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/refs/heads/main/Other_Files/Demon_Install_Script/Demon_Vars_Installer.sh | bash
```

```
[update_manager Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified]

origin: https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified.git
primary_branch: main
is_system_service: False
managed_services: klipper
```
Here's some info on the `update_manager` section if you need it. https://docs.mainsail.xyz/setup/updates/update-manager

****************************************************************************************************************************

<br>

# Define Force Move Section

Be sure to define the force move section in your printer.cfg file or your printer wont be able to make use of the new homing routine. 
```
[force_move]
enable_force_move: True
```

# Idle Timeout printer.cfg 

To use the new timeout settings correctly you should set your `printer.cfg` `[idle_timeout]` section like this:
```
[idle_timeout]
gcode:
    _DEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT
timeout: 3600
```

This will call the new Demon timeout macro after 1 hour & execute the functions of your choice in the demon_user_settings file

****************************************************************************************************************************

# Load & Unload Macros


>[!NOTE]
>Klipperscreen Macros copy/paste into file is no longer required. Any previous copies of these LOAD/UNLOAD macros must be removed from any additional macro.cfg files in favour of the new included LOAD/UNLOAD macros. If you do not do this then there will be issues with the loading & unloading of filament.

All load & unload macros now check the printer's `max_extrude_only_velocity` setting, a value of 20 or below will pass the check. 

Be sure your `printer.cfg` file `[extruder]` section contains...

```
max_extrude_only_velocity: 15
```

****************************************************************************************************************************

# Printer Lights (White LEDs)
Be sure to name any White LEDs that are on an output_pin in the `printer.cfg` file you wish the macros to control to:

```
[output_pin Printer_Lights]
```
****************************************************************************************************************************

# Neopixel Toolhead LEDs 

....if using a Voron or another machine with neopixel LEDs in the toolhead. Be sure to name any neopixel toolhead LEDs:

```
[neopixel sb_leds]   
```
Or you will get an invalid for LED error.

....If you're using an SV08 leave the neopixel LEDs their defualt name:
```
[neopixel Screen_Colour]
```
If you have more than 3 neopixel LEDs in your chain be sure to correctly edit the file you're using to include all LEDs in the chain. By default it is set for 3 Stealthburner style toolhead LEDs.
You will need to change this if you have a long chain or use neopixels elsewhere on your printer.

# Setting up KLIPPER's Adaptive Mesh option. 

There is no longer any need for a separate KAMP install for meshing. The adaptive purge line & smart park are still needed.

For Klipper's Adaptive Mesh feature to work you must have:
- You must have a version of Klipper later than 1st Feb 2024
- Enabled your Slicer for `Label Objects`
- It's good to have `Exclude Objects` too...
- Added the `file_manager` section to your `moonraker.conf` file for `object processing`  
- Added the `Exclude Object` section to your `printer.cfg` file

>[!TIP]
>Find options under Orca main window Process/Global/Others

![ORCA Label](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2e51dab-a695-4eff-b637-a0b039e3e219)


Add this to your `moonraker.conf` file:
```
[file_manager]
enable_object_processing: True
```

Add this to your `printer.cfg` file:
```
[exclude_object]
```

Save & restart!

# Setting up KAMP_LiTE Adaptive Purge & Smart Park

KAMP_LiTE is simply KAMP but without the adpative meshing macro, as it is not required now klipper has Adaptive Meshing included by default. However the Adpative Purge & Smart Park features are still very useful! Changes listed in the link.

You must have a version of Klipper later than 1st Feb 2024. You must have completed the steps described in the above section.

Also the fork KAMP_LiTE must be installed & included, how to do this is in the below link:

https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/KAMP_LiTE/releases/tag/v1.0


You must set your desired values in the KAMP_Settings.cfg

![KAMP_LiTE Settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11708975-5592-489c-b1f4-f299d99afb41)

Then you must activate the KAMP settings in the `demon_user_settings_v*.cfg` file.

![KAMP_LiTE Vars](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/309e6f1a-a8a0-41d5-aa76-646a6efdade5)

To use correctly ensure your `extruder` section in your `printer.cfg` has the line below defined & that its set to 5 or higher, if not the KAMP purge will be skipped & it wont work!
```
max_extrude_cross_section: 5
```

>[!NOTE]
>If `variable_adaptive_meshing` is set to `True` then the system will override the values for `variable_use_kamp_adaptive_purge` & `variable_use_kamp_smart_park`. It will always use the adaptive purge & smart park features no matter what the >settings are. Even if they're set to false.

# BE SURE TO SET YOUR MACRO VARIABLES & WATCH THESE VIDEOS!

- Configure the macros in one place! Set the variables for all the Demon Klipper Essentials macros in the `demon_user_settings` file
- Configure the cleaner/purge bucket variables in the `demon_user_settings_cleaner_variables` file
- There is no need to edit any macro code with this macro pack!
- NOTE: If you don't set `_CLEAN_VARIABLES` the printer will give you an error if you haven’t done this & try to use the nozzle clean macros.

# FEATURE: DEMON HOMING CONTROL!

This sort of thing has been available for some time elsewhere but this is the first time we have a version integrated here in the 3DPrintDemon macros. This feature will lower the motor current on the X & Y axis motors when homing the printer & then increase it again to normal levels afterwards! This means your printer will be a little more gentle when homing. 

This system will also not let you home the printer with the toolhead under 5mm high & it’ll always raise the Z axis by an amount of your choosing if the motors are disarmed BEFORE actually homing the printer in the Z & Y axes. Plus when the motors are armed & the printer is in a homed state after that initial raise it won’t raise the axis again when homing until they’re disarmed or homing is commanded at <5mm! 
So there’s no more risk of homing at Z0.2mm after a stoppage or a Z offset calibration test or risk hitting any clips or nozzle cleaners etc!
Not only that the homing macros know automatically if you’re using a BTT Eddy Probe or not and will adapt themselves to it!

****************************************************************************************************************************

<br>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>DEMON Homing Control - IMPORTANT!
To use the `demon_homing_control_v1.2.cfg` file
be sure to comment out or un-include & disable any old homing or sensorless homing macros you might have, you will also need to comment out any old `[safe_homing]` & `[homing_override]` sections in your `printer,cfg` or macro files.
>
>UNLESS you’re using `Klicky Probe`!
>
>For printers using `Klicky Probe` [you need to do this to get things to work correctly!](https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/blob/main/Documentation/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/General_Setup_For_All_Printers/Kicky_Probe_Users.md)

****************************************************************************************************************************

## Z Endstop Switch

If you’re using your printer with a separate endstop switch & you are NOT using the `Klicky` macros you need to set the location of your Z endstop switch in the Demon macros `demon_user_settings_v*.cfg file`. There’s two variables for you to define the location of your separate endstop switch.

Open the `demon_user_settings_v*.cfg` file & search 

```
z_endstop_location_x
``` 
&...
```
z_endstop_location_y
```
then enter your switch axis locations.

There are also other definable homing options to set there too! So be sure to setup ALL your homing variables & tune your sensorless homing values in your `printer.cfg` at the desired homing power levels, & to check that your chosen endstop will trigger when needed! 

When testing homing for the first time be EXTREMELY CAREFUL & be ready to hit EMERGENCY STOP!! You may need to abort the homing process.

If for any reason you wish to revert back to your normal homing system, simply comment all back in from your old system & disable the `demon_homing_control_v*.cfg` file by commenting out its full content apart from the file version number at the bottom. Make your selection & then by then `ctrl+/` on wondows or `cmd+/` on MacOS.

## DEMON HOMING CONTROL SETTINGS 
Found in the demon_user_settings_v2.9.cfg onwards.

For use here with the Demon macros we need to be using the regular version (non-homing & non-offset)
https://github.com/bigtreetech/Eddy/blob/master/sample-bigtreetech-eddy.cfg

For a Printer with `Eddy Probe` being used as your Z endstop probe, basically homing the printer with the probe (No separate Z endstop Switch) you need to modify their file. 
Don’t worry it’s super simple! Open the file linked above & “comment in” lines 101-105.

 IMPORTANT>>>>>>> LEAVE  LINE 106 COMMENTED OUT!! 

I REPEAT LEAVE LINE 106 COMMENTED OUT!!! Comment in lines 101-05 ONLY!

##### NOTE: If you're using Eddy as a bed scanner only & have a separate endstop switch DO NOT do the above. Leave the file as it is.

Actual Probe setup & calibration. You will need to setup your Eddy Probe still, steps how to do this are here:
https://github.com/bigtreetech/Eddy/blob/master/README.md

</details>

Once Your probe is setup correctly & tested working as per the above BTT github guide all Demon Z_Probe calibration, machine meshing & machine levelling macros all now automatically detect & support BTT Eddy Probe! Just hit go & it’ll do its thing!

## Eddy Coil Setup
if you're using the Coil version of the Eddy Probe & are struggling to set it up here is what you need! edited cfg file with correct settings for use with a EBB36 & set up to deal with high temperature printing. 



****************************************************************************************************************************

<br>

# FIRST HOMING TEST!

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Be sure you have included the files correctly & have set everything up as well as possible.

If you are sure you have covered all items general and model/setup specific you can attempt your first homing! Be sure to double check your probe &/or Z endstop is working correctly!

When you try to home the printer for the first time cover the EMERGENCY STOP button incase something goes wrong. Also pay attention to the console in Mainsail, it should output a sequence like this...


![Homing_Console](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/207b57d1-7738-40ff-aa3b-980e737e7fdf)


If the console only shows `G28` for example there is an issue with your demon_homing_control file, please abort homing & check the system!

>[!CAUTION]
>Improper setup of the macros & the demon_homing_control feature can & will cause damage to your printer! It is down to you to make sure this system is operational before use!
No liability or responsibility will be accpeted for any damage caused by the use of these macros.

# Additional Configuration - EXTRA STEPS



## Chamber Monitoring & Fan Control

To get the most from these macros you’ll need to add a Chamber thermistor to your machine if you haven’t already & a Chamber exhaust fan. 
- If you have a Chamber exhaust fan call it `[temperature_fan chamber]`
- If you instead have a Chamber Thermistor only & no Exhaust fan call it `[temperature_sensor Chamber_Temp]`

For use with a chamber fan...
```

## Printer LED lights
- If you have printer LED lights (NOT neopixel) call them `[output_pin Printer_Lights]`
- NeoPixel LEDs are dealt with in the additionally installed files.

****************************************************************************************************************************

## Filament Sensor
If you have or are going to install a filament sensor this must be added to your `printer.cfg` file to run the filament sensor. The filament runout check in the `PRINT_START` macro can then be enabled & disabled in the `_START_VARIABLES` macro if you dont have one or dont want to perform the check at the start of the print.
```
[filament_switch_sensor filament_sensor]

# Auto Shutdown Moonraker Power Device

To make use of the `_GOODNIGHT` post print auto shutdown macro you must enable your RPI as a secondary MCU so it can control your shutdown relay hardware. Use this link to do that.

- https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/blob/master/docs/RPi_microcontroller.md

After you've followed the process in that link be sure that this is added to your `printer.cfg` file.
```
[mcu host]
serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu
```

## Word of warning! Adding a power control device like a power shutdown relay can sometimes involve working with & modifying your printer’s wiring that runs on mains level voltage!  This can be extremely dangerous with a definite risk of serious injury, fire, loss of property & even death! You have been warned. I accept no liability or responsibility for any loss, death or injury caused directly or indirectly by you or anyone else attempting this! This is all on you, attempt implementation ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Connections

Example below for using the BTT Power Relay v1.2

See the install instructions for this product on the BTT Github! 

- https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-Relay-V1.2

However….

This link is far more helpful! 

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wJff-hY90s

You will need ensure that you have set your instance to be able to control your Pi’s GPIO pins as mentioned previously in this document. Then you need to choose which 2 GPIO pins on your Rpi to use to control the relay, connect the `Printer Power` GPIO pin along with a single ground pin to the PSon plug on the relay board. You have to then connect the Pi's `Reset Power` GPIO pin to the `reset` pin on the relay board, leave the 5v pin next to it empty.

Then if you wish you can add a physical momentary switch to a 3rd GPIO pin & another ground pin. Then mount it somewhere of your choice on your printer. This button will act as an instant on button & re-power the printer with a single push, normally you have to manually switch both pins on yourself but now Moonraker will now activate both pins at the same time for you! Magic!

## Setup

Then you need to SSH into your pi & run:

>[!NOTE]
>these commands are for a real Rpi, cloned system or systems built on different images will probably vary.

```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```
Then near the bottom of the file at the end of the first section & in the space BEFORE the start of the `[CM4]` section paste in:
```
gpio=16=op,dh # Example GPIO pin, choose a GPIO pin to control power device’s PSon pin
```
Then use the commands at the bottom of the screen to exit & save the file.

This will make sure that the GPIO pin you will use for the relay’s `PSon` pin is automatically pulled “high” when the Pi is first turned on at the beginning of the host boot sequence. This in turn should keep your relay from automatically opening & shutting the printer down while the Pi is booting. It does this at boot because the power relay is not seeing the ‘keep switched on’ signal from the Pi, & it needs that signal. 
Trust me it is very annoying if you don’t do this!

You will then need to modify your `Moonraker.conf` file by adding these…
```
[button PowerUp]
type: gpio
pin: ^gpio21 # Example GPIO pin, you can choose your own here
minimum_event_time: .05
on_press:
  {% do call_method("machine.device_power.post_device", device="Reset Power", action="on") %}
  {% do call_method("machine.device_power.post_device", device="Printer Power", action="on") %}

[power Printer Power]
type:gpio
pin:gpio16 # Example GPIO pin, you can choose your own here
on_when_job_queued: True
initial_state:on
off_when_shutdown: True
locked_while_printing: False
restart_klipper_when_powered: False
# restart_delay: 2
bound_services:

[power Reset Power]
type:gpio
pin:gpio12 # Example GPIO pin, you can choose your own here
on_when_job_queued: True
locked_while_printing: True
initial_state:off
restart_klipper_when_powered: True
restart_delay: 2
Timer:2
```
You need these two pins as the BTT relay firmware requires a reset command while the `PSon` pin is high. If this is not the case & the `PSon` pin is low (off) & you hit reset the relay power up but trip out again after 8 seconds. This is normal. The `PSon` pin must be high (on) when the reset is pressed. The PowerUp physical button will activate both GPIO pins together when pushed meaning you only need a single push of the physical button to control both pins & re-power the printer instantly.

After that add this macro to your `macros.cfg`
```
[gcode_macro M81]
gcode:
 {action_call_remote_method("set_device_power",device="Printer Power",state="off")}
```

Lastly this is used by the `PRINT_END` macro to select the Auto Shutdown feature & should be pasted into your `printer.cfg` file.
```
[output_pin PRINTER_AUTO_OFF]
pin: ### <<<<<< Insert unused board pin for state change only, monitored by system
```
This will give you full control of your power relay unit via the GUI Switch & the `PRINT_END` & `_GOODNIGHT` macros.

****************************************************************************************************************************

<br>

## Extra Bonus...
As an added bonus you can add a second physical button to a 4th GPIO pin to use as a physical Emergency Stop button!

```
[button estop]
type: gpio
pin: gpio26 # Example GPIO pin, you can choose your own here
on_press:
  {% do call_method("printer.emergency_stop") %}
```


If you made it to the end here congrats!
