# Orca Slicer Setup

You have to modify your slicer's `Machine Gcode` that is sent to the printer.
The basic commands to do this are in the macro files, the expanded setup for use with Orca slicer is shown below, please take special care to copy them in correctly, as even a single error can stop the whole system from working.
Below shows a fully setup slicer as per recommended Mainsail settings combined with the macro settings for Orca Slicer using relative extrusion.

Cut/paste your current gcode out of the gcode window & into Notepad/Notes to save if you ever revert back & need it again. Replace your old Start gcode with the correct one for your slicer.
the example below is for Orca slicer. 
It's very important the last line of the `Machine Start Gcode` is a single long line as shown below, with no returns in it. 
If this is not the case the system will fail as soon as you start a print.

###### NOTE: If your screen can't hold the text in a single line the computer will place it on mulitple lines itself, however there will not be actual "returns" placed into it, as far as the printer will see it will still be one long line.

Here is how they should look in Ocra Slicer.

These are fully setup codes as per recommended Mainsail settings combined with the macro settings for Orca Slicer using relative extrusion, as per the image....

Machine Start G-code:

```
SET_PRINT_STATS_INFO TOTAL_LAYER=[total_layer_count]
M104 S0
M140 S0
PRINT_START EXTRUDER=[nozzle_temperature_initial_layer] BED=[hot_plate_temp_initial_layer] LAYER=[layer_height] FILAMENT=[filament_type] EXCLUDE=[exclude_object] SURFACE="[curr_bed_type]" OAPA=[adaptive_pressure_advance]
```
Machine end G-code:
```
; printing object ENDGCODE
PRINT_END
```

Before layer change G-code:
```
;BEFORE_LAYER_CHANGE
;[layer_z]
G92 E0
```

Layer change G-code:
```
;AFTER_LAYER_CHANGE
;[layer_z]
SET_PRINT_STATS_INFO CURRENT_LAYER={layer_num + 1}
M117 Layer {layer_num+1}/[total_layer_count] : {filament_settings_id[0]}
```

Change filament G-code:
```
_FIL_CHANGE_PARK
```

Change extrusion role G-code:
```
_DEMON_ADAPTIVE_PA TYPE=[extrusion_role]
```

Pause G-code:
```
PAUSE
```
