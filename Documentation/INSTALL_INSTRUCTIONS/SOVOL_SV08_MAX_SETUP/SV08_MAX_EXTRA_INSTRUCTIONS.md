# IF YOU'RE USING A SOVOL SV08 MAX PRINTER!

<br>

>[!NOTE]
>When complete the printer will give you some unknown command errors relating to the commented out plr.cfg file. This is because Sovol have hardcoded these commands into Klipper/Moonraker & I am yet to find where they're being called from! Once I find the source of the calls I'll update things. In the meantime these messages can safely be ignored.

# Timelapse Use

If you wish to continue to use Timelapse be sure to add this back in your slicer's `Before Layer Change` gcode box.
```
TIMELAPSE_TAKE_FRAME
```
<br>

# PLR (Power Loss Recovery) Use

You can now use the Sovol PLR system with DEKU macros! To do this simply add

```
LOG_Z
```
To your slicer's `Layer Change` box in `Machine Gcode`

<img width="517" height="222" alt="ZLOG" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0626aa47-1335-407f-8a69-d8fd778dac18" />

Be sure to include your PLR.cfg file now!
```
[include plr.cfg]
```

Then in the demon_user_settings file near the top set

```
variable_sovol_plr: True
```

Now Save & Restart.

>[!TIP]
>Once the macros see you have set the above variable `True` they will ask you if you wish to automatically download & install all required files to use the Sovol PLR system with DEKU macros. If you click `GET` on the pop up prompt your machine will reboot to bring the new files into the system.

# SV08 MAX CUSTOM EXPANSION FILE! - REQUIRED!!

>[!IMPORTANT]
>BE SURE YOU FOLLOW THIS SECTION!!!!!

>[!CAUTION]
>DAMAGE MAY RESULT IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS!!!

>[!NOTE]
>The command below MUST have at least 2 presses of the spacebar at the start of the line it's on for it to work!
>
>It must NOT be at the very start of the line! If you click the copy text button box below the correct spacing "should" be applied when you paste it in, but please check the command is correctly indented before use!

Go into the demon_custom_expansion cfg file & under the `[gcode_macro _CUSTOM_PRE_LEVEL]` section & paste in...
```
    _OFFSET_FORCE_OVERLAY
```

Then be sure to set `variable_ceal_master_enable:` & the `variable_pre_level:` both to...
```
True
```

By doing this you make sure the printer has the correct Z Offset for printing! 

<br>

# THE TRICKY SSH BIT!

In this section you'll modify the way your SV08 MAX deals with a couple of things, firstly when you insert filament into the auto feeder unit it'll now automatically grab the end & start feeding the filament to the extruder - you will no longer have to hit the button to start it! The button will still be fully functional as before.

Secondly the printer will now choose a random spot around the centre home location to tap the bed so it will NOT tap the same place over & over for every print!

Lastly the buffer_stepper.cfg file ties it all together & gives increased functionality especially when used with an HDMI touchscreen!

## Install Direct Via SSH 

Start by changing directory to:

```
cd ~/klipper/klippy/extras
```

## The first way is the safe way where these four commands will make your current file into a backup file ending in `.1` & then download the new files to use instead - RECOMMENDED!!

You need ALL FOUR of these files!
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DPrintDemon/DEMON-SV08MAX/refs/heads/main/DEMON_SV08_MAX_REPLACEMENT_FILES/filament_switch_sensor.py --backups=1
```
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DPrintDemon/DEMON-SV08MAX/refs/heads/main/DEMON_SV08_MAX_REPLACEMENT_FILES/z_offset_calibration.py --backups=1
```
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DPrintDemon/DEMON-SV08MAX/refs/heads/main/DEMON_SV08_MAX_REPLACEMENT_FILES/buffer_stepper.py --backups=1
```
```
cd ~/printer_data/config
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DPrintDemon/DEMON-SV08MAX/refs/heads/main/DEMON_SV08_MAX_REPLACEMENT_FILES/buffer_stepper.cfg  --backups=1
```

Restart

```
sudo reboot now
```

<br>

## The second way is available if you simply want to overwrite your current files & not make a backup - USE WITH CAUTION!!

You need ALL FOUR of these files!
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DPrintDemon/DEMON-SV08MAX/refs/heads/main/DEMON_SV08_MAX_REPLACEMENT_FILES/filament_switch_sensor.py --backups=0
```
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DPrintDemon/DEMON-SV08MAX/refs/heads/main/DEMON_SV08_MAX_REPLACEMENT_FILES/z_offset_calibration.py --backups=0
```
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DPrintDemon/DEMON-SV08MAX/refs/heads/main/DEMON_SV08_MAX_REPLACEMENT_FILES/buffer_stepper.py --backups=0
```
```
cd ~/printer_data/config
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DPrintDemon/DEMON-SV08MAX/refs/heads/main/DEMON_SV08_MAX_REPLACEMENT_FILES/buffer_stepper.cfg  --backups=0
```

Restart

```
sudo reboot now
```

*********************************

<br>

## Optional Download & Manual Install

<br>

Download the `filament_switch_sensor.py`, the `z_offset_calibration.py` & the `buffer_stepper.cfg` files found here.

https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/DEMON-SV08MAX/tree/main/DEMON_SV08_MAX_REPLACEMENT_FILES

<br>

Open your chosen SFTP client & login to your SV08 MAX

Naviagate to....

```
/home/sovol/klipper/klippy/extras
```

Find the `filament_switch_sensor.py` & the `z_offset_calibration.py` files already in your system & download them to keep safe as a backup!!! IMPORTANT!!!

Now upload the modified files, overwriting the current files.


Naviagate to....

```
/home/sovol/printer_data/config
```

Find the `buffer_stepper.cfg` file already in your system & download them to keep safe as a backup!!! IMPORTANT!!!

Now upload the modified files, overwriting the current files.

Restart the printer.

# Edit Your printer.cfg 

[DON'T FORGET TO DO ALL THE OTHER STUFF IN THE GENERAL SETUP TOO!](https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/blob/main/Documentation/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/General_Setup_For_All_Printers/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Be sure to comment out the Sovol/Mainline [save_variables] section in the printer.cfg file!!

Comment out these stock sections

```
# [idle_timeout]
# gcode: _IDLE_TIMEOUT
# timeout: 1800

# [save_variables]
# filename =/home/sovol/printer_data/config/saved_variables.cfg
```

Paste in these for use with DKEU macros!

```
[idle_timeout]
gcode:
    _DEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT
timeout: 3600

[save_variables]
filename = ~/demon_vars.cfg
```

Be sure your `printer.cfg` file `[extruder]` section contains...

```
max_extrude_only_velocity: 22
```
```
max_extrude_cross_section: 5
```
This is used by the load/unload macros & is converted into feedrate of mm/s & is limited to 20.

<br>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>YOU MUST, I REPEAT MUST DISABLE ALL THE SOVOL MACROS BY COMMENTING OUT THE macro.cfg FILE INCLUDE IN THE printer.cfg FILE!

Includes should look like this!

```
[include mainsail.cfg]
#[include chamber_hot.cfg]
[include buffer_stepper.cfg]
[include timelapse.cfg]
[include plr.cfg]
# [include Macro.cfg]
# [include moonraker_obico_macros.cfg]
[include ./Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/*.cfg]
[include ./Demon_User_Files/*.cfg]
[include ./Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/Other_Files/Demon_User_Files_Updater/Extract_Demon_User_Files_Sovol.cfg]
[include ./KAMP_LiTE/*.cfg]
[include ./Heat_Soak.cfg]
[include ./My_Macros.cfg]
```

<br>

Change the [printer] section to reduce the simply crazy stock acceleration values of 40k & add the new `minimum_cruise_ratio` parameter. Default value is 0.5, a value of 0.35 will reduce the amount of time the 
toolhead will be allowed to be at maximum speed. A value of 0.75 will allow the toolhead to stay at maximum speed longer but might lower print quality.

```
[printer]
kinematics: corexy
max_velocity: 700
max_accel: 5500      
minimum_cruise_ratio: 0.35
max_z_velocity: 20
max_z_accel: 500
square_corner_velocity: 5.0
```

<br>

Change the [resonance_tester] section to this to remove the limits added by the commented out values! This will give you the proper full test & not cut it off early as it does stock!

```
[resonance_tester]
accel_chip: lis2dw
probe_points: 250, 250, 30  
max_smoothing: 0.05
# accel_per_hz:100
# min_freq: 35
# max_freq: 45
# hz_per_sec: 1.0
```

<br>

>[!CAUTION]
> You MUST make sure you comment out the entire [homing_override] section, you dont need it as we will be using the DKEU homing system!

```
# [homing_override]
# gcode:
#    {% if not 'Z' in params and not 'Y' in params and 'X' in params %}
#      {% if printer.toolhead.homed_axes != "xyz" %}
#        G90
#        G0 Z5 F300
#      {% endif %}
#      M9928 X
#    {% elif not 'Z' in params and not 'X' in params and 'Y' in params %}
#      {% if printer.toolhead.homed_axes != "xyz" %}
#        G90
#        G0 Z5 F300
#      {% endif %}
#      M9928 Y
#    {% elif not 'Z' in params and 'X' in params and 'Y' in params %}
#      {% if printer.toolhead.homed_axes != "xyz" %}
#        G90
#        G0 Z5 F300
#      {% endif %}
#      M9928 X
#      M9928 Y
#    {% elif 'Z' in params and not 'X' in params and not 'Y' in params %}
#      G90
#      G0  X271 Y251 F9000
#      M9928 Z
#      G0  Z10 F600
#    {% else %}
#      G90
#      G0 Z5 F300
#      M9928 X
#      M9928 Y
#      G90
#      G0  X271 Y251 F9000
#      M9928 Z
#      G0  Z10 F600
#    {% endif %}
# axes: xyz
# set_position_z: 0
```

<br>

Make sure your [stepper_z] section looks like this as the stock file has the `position_min` set to -10!! this is crazy & should NOT be this much, -1.5 is much better as if you ever have a homing error the printer wont try to
plant the nozzle through the floor!

```
[stepper_z]  #z1
step_pin: PA8
dir_pin: PC9
enable_pin: !PA10
rotation_distance: 40         
gear_ratio: 80:12             
microsteps: 16
endstop_pin: probe: z_virtual_endstop
position_max: 505             
position_min: -1.5 #-10              
homing_speed: 10.0
homing_retract_dist: 5.0
homing_retract_speed: 10.0
second_homing_speed: 5.0
```

<br>

Comment out the stock Fan & LED sections!

```
# [fan_generic fan0] # front model cool fan
# pin: extra_mcu: PB0
# max_power: 1.0

# [fan_generic fan1] # back model cool fan
# pin: extra_mcu: PA7
# max_power: 1.0

# [fan_generic fan2] # auxiliary fan
# pin: PB0
# max_power: 1.0

# [fan_generic fan3] # exhaust fan
# pin: PE11
# max_power: 1.0

# [output_pin main_led]
# pin: PD13
# value: 1.0
```

Paste in these modified section for use with DKEU macros & improved function!

```
[multi_pin fan_pins]
pins: extra_mcu:PA7, extra_mcu:PB0

[fan]
pin:multi_pin: fan_pins
max_power: 1.0
shutdown_speed: 0
kick_start_time: 0.5

[fan_generic fan2] 
pin: PE11
tachometer_pin: PE13
tachometer_ppr: 1
tachometer_poll_interval: 0.0075
max_power: 1.0

[fan_generic fan3] 
pin: PB0
tachometer_pin: PB1
tachometer_ppr: 1
tachometer_poll_interval: 0.0075
max_power: 1.0

[led Printer_Lights]
white_pin: PD13
cycle_time: 0.001
initial_WHITE: 1.0
```

>[!TIP]
>In Orca Slicer click the edit box on the printer name at the top of the screen to bring up the `Printer Settings` window, then in the `Basic information` tab at the very bottom under `Accessory` be sure to uncheck the `Auxiliary part cooling fan` option. This will stop Orca keeping the fans on after printing.

<br>

Next comment out the stock [heater_fan bed_fan] section as it's not the correct setup for this fan!

```
# [heater_fan bed_fan]      
# pin: PE14
# max_power: 1.0               
# kick_start_time: 0.5         
# heater: heater_bed             
# heater_temp: 35              
# tachometer_pin: PB10
# tachometer_ppr: 2
# tachometer_poll_interval: 0.001375
```

Paste in this modified section for improved function & a LOT less noise during operation! This will power the bed SSR fan only when its on & leave it for 5 minutes after its been switched off!

```
[controller_fan Bed_SSR_Fan]
pin: PE14  
max_power: 1.0               
kick_start_time: 0.5
fan_speed: 1.0
idle_timeout: 600

# KlipperScreen Feed In & Feed Out Menu Buttons!

>[!TIP]
>Don't miss this if you're using KlipperScreen!

To add filament feed in & out buttons to the custom Demon `Prepare` KlipperScreen menu be sure you have followed [this section](https://github.com/3DPrintDemon/Demon_Klipper_Essentials_Unified/blob/main/Documentation/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS/General_Setup_For_All_Printers/INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS.md#modifying-klipperscreen-menus-for-new-features) of the main documentation & then paste these two blocks at the bottom of the original section you pasted in!

This will give you quick & easy access to control the Auto Feeder via the touchscreen!

```
[menu __main custom feed_in]
name: Feed In
icon: arrow-down
method: printer.gcode.script
params: {"script":"_FEED_IN"}

[menu __main custom feed_out]
name: Feed Out
icon: arrow-up
method: printer.gcode.script
params: {"script":"_FEED_OUT"}
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>In the `buffer_stepper.cfg` file you have just installed you will need to add the pins shown a few lines down to use as a manual override for the clog & Jam detection.
This will allow you to disable the automated clog & Jam detection system during a print if you keep getting false triggers!

# Add Clog Detection Override Pin!

See line 45 of the `buffer_stepper.cfg` file, under the `[output_pin CLOG_DETECTION]` & add this pin...

```
pin: PC12
```

<br>

# Add Jam Detection Override Pin!

See line 49 of the `buffer_stepper.cfg` file, under the `[output_pin JAM_DETECTION]` & add this pin...

```
pin: PC11
```


****************************************************************************************************************************

<br>

# ADD EXTRA UNPUBLISHED PINS FOR MORE FUNCTIONS HERE!!

Here you can find a selection of extra pins on the stock SV08 MAX mainboard for expanding your system!

- 1x disable/enable clog detection switch
- 2x thermistor pins, great for chamber & case sensors!
- 3x digital output pins, gcode buttons or I/O sensor pins @3.3v
- 2x chains of multicolour neopixel LED chains!
